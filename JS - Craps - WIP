/*Problem: Develop the game of Craps for an online Casino Games website. 

Assignment: Craps is a game of chance based on the sum of two rolled dice. 
Your program should simulate a player having a bankroll of $500 and he/she 
can bet as much of it as they choose.

/*
A typical game follows this pattern:

The roller makes a Wager. 
The two dice are rolled and their sum calculated. 
A 7 or 11 on the first roll results in an automatic Win. 
It’s called a Natural and the roller’s wager gets double their Wager
A 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll results in an automatic loss.  
This is called Craps and the roller loses their Wager 
Any other number ( 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) becomes the point. 
If the user rolls a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 on the first roll, 
the program continues to roll until one of the following happens: 
They roll their point again.  This is a Win (double Wager) 
The roll a 7 - This is a loss(lose Wager) 
At the end of the turn, the users bankroll should be updated according 
to either winning or losing. And they should be asked if they want to roll again. 
If they say or choose yes, the process repeats, otherwise the program exits and 
they are thanked for playing and told how much they leave the game with.

Hints to get started:

One thing we need to be able to do in our program is to "roll the dice". 
We'll need to check (and probably print to the user!) what the most recent 
value was for each of the two die when they were rolled. Rolling one die 
can be thought of as generating a random number between [1,6] (inclusive). 
See your Javascript cheatsheet for random numbers in a range...

What other numeric values do we need to keep track of? We'll need variables for these...

What "conditions" do we need to keep track of? An important condition is 
whether the most recent roll of the dice resulted in a win, loss, or to simply continue.

Some conditions you will check one time, so you'll use an "if" statement. 
For some parts of craps, you'll keep doing the same thing until some condition occurs 
-- so you'll want to think about using a for or while loop.
